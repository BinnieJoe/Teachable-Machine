## What is Teachable Machine?
Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible for everyone. You can try it here.

## Who is it for?
Educators, artists, students, innovators, makers of all kinds â€“ really, anyone who has an idea they want to explore. No prerequisite machine learning knowledge required.

## How does it work?
You train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, and poses without writing any machine learning code. Then, use your model in your own projects, sites, apps, and more.

## Skills
- **Teachable Machine**: A platform that helps users easily train machine learning models
- **Object Recognition**: Experience in recognizing specific objects using Teachable Machine
- **Data Labeling**: Preparing for model training by uploading and labeling image data
- **Basic Machine Learning Understanding**: Basic understanding of model training process and result analysis

## A Python GUI program utilizing an AI model created with Teachable. 
- This program does not use a camera. 
- It identifies four different classes. 
- The model performance (images) can be accessed in the REPO under the "Model" folder.
